# Power BI Dashboard – Maritime Performance Analytics

This dashboard consumes BI-ready CSV outputs generated by the Python pipeline.

## Data Sources
- performance_summary.csv
- cleaned_data.csv

## Design Principles
- Clear separation of executive KPIs and engineering metrics
- Normalized performance indicators (fuel per NM, CO₂ per NM)
- Traceable linkage to validated source data

## Intended Audience
- Operations & performance teams
- Sustainability / ESG reporting
- Technical and commercial stakeholders
