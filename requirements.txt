## Agents Description

### 1. Ingestion Agent
- Reads raw vessel operational data
- Standardizes schema and column naming
- Prepares data for validation

### 2. Validation Agent
- Cleans missing or malformed records
- Converts numeric fields safely
- Ensures consistent data types
- Outputs a clean, analysis-ready dataset

### 3. Performance Analytics Agent
- Splits data into pre- and post-trial phases
- Computes average fuel consumption, speed, and emissions
- Normalizes metrics using fuel-per-nautical-mile logic
- Calculates:
  - Fuel reduction percentage
  - CO₂ reduction percentage
  - Efficiency index

### 4. Reporting Agent
- Generates summarized, BI-ready tables
- Designed for direct ingestion into Power BI or similar tools

## Key Metrics Produced

| Metric | Description |
|------|------------|
| Avg Fuel Mass | Mean fuel consumption per phase |
| Avg CO₂ Emissions | Mean emissions per phase |
| Avg Speed | Average vessel speed |
| Fuel per NM | Fuel normalized by speed |
| CO₂ per NM | Emissions normalized by speed |
| Efficiency Index | Fuel-per-NM efficiency indicator |
| Fuel Reduction % | Pre vs post fuel improvement |
| CO₂ Reduction % | Pre vs post emissions improvement |

## Sample Results (From Demo Data)

- **Fuel reduction:** ~10.7%
- **CO₂ reduction:** ~7.3%
- **Speed:** Slightly increased post-trial
- **Efficiency:** ~13% improvement

These results are realistic, conservative, and engineering-defensible.
